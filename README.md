# Overview of School District Analysis
A revised analysis of the school district's metrics was performed after a review of the original analysis discovered potential anomalies in Thomas High School's ninth graders' math and reading scores submitted to the Board. 

In the revised analysis, we have removed all of Thomas High School's ninth graders' math and reading scores so as not to disadvantage other schools. It is important to note that since we have only removed those scores instead of replacing them with corrected information, the entire analysis is still not necessarily representative of how the district as a whole has done, depending on how different the corrected information we obtain from Thomas High School is from the original version submitted.

## Impact on District Summary

Revised District Summary:

In the Revised District Summary, we have presented the % Passing information to one decimal point to show that removing Thomas High School's (THS) ninth graders' math and reading scores have no overall impact on the District Summary.

Revised Thomas High School's Summary:

The impact of removing THS' ninth graders' math and reading scores to THS' summary is almost negligible.

### Impact on Thomas High School's Ranking

Revised Top Five Schools:

Although THS is still ranked number two in the Top Five Schools, the submission of questionable data for their ninth graders' math and reading scores does make one suspect that should the actual scores be submitted, THS' ranking might have been adversely affected.

## Impact on Math and Reading Scores by Grade
Original vs Revised Math Scores by Grade

Original vs Revised Reading Scores by Grade

![revised reading scores](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/revised_reading_scores_by_grade.png)

As we can see from the revised tables on the right, THS' ninth graders' math and reading scores have been replaced with "nan". Should these tables be published, it would certainly raise questions over the omission of those scores.

### Impact on Ninth Graders' Math and Reading Scores
Original Average Math and Reading Scores vs Revised Average Math and Reading Scores of all Ninth Graders:

![revised average scores](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/revised_ninth_grade_scores.png)

According to the above calculations, we can see that the removal of THS' ninth graders' math and reading scores have very little impact on the district's ninth graders' average math and reading scores.

## Impact on District's Other Metrics
Since the impact of the removal of THS' ninth graders' math and reading scores on THS' overall metrics is negligible, we do not expect there to be any material impact on the other metrics we are reporting on, namely, Scores by School Spending, Scores by School Size and Scores by School Type. The following are evidence of that.

### Impact on District's Scores by School Spending

## Summary
The overall impact of the removal of THS' questionable scores was very small. We had to analyse the numbers to at least one decimal place in order to identify the differences within THS' metrics, and they are listed as follows:
- Average Reading Score of THS was 83.8 and it became 83.9;
- % Passing Math was 93.3 and it became 93.2;
- % Passing Reading was 97.3 and it became 97.0; and
- % Overall Passing was 90.9 and it became 90.6.
