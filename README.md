# Overview of School District Analysis
A revised analysis of the school district's metrics was performed after a review of the original analysis discovered potential anomalies in Thomas High School's ninth graders' math and reading scores submitted to the Board. 

In the revised analysis, we have removed all of Thomas High School's ninth graders' math and reading scores so as not to disadvantage other schools. It is important to note that since we have only removed those scores instead of replacing them with corrected information, the entire analysis is still not necessarily representative of how the district as a whole has done, depending on how different the corrected information we obtain from Thomas High School is from the original version submitted.

In the Revised District Summary, we have presented the % Passing information to one decimal point to show that removing Thomas High School's (THS) ninth graders' math and reading scores have no overall impact on the District Summary.

The impact of removing THS' ninth graders' math and reading scores to THS' summary is almost negligible.

### Impact on Thomas High School's Ranking

Although THS is still ranked number two in the Top Five Schools, the submission of questionable data for their ninth graders' math and reading scores does make one suspect that should the actual scores have been submitted, THS' ranking might have been adversely affected.
